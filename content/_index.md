University of Cambridge graduate in electrical and information engineering
working at [Signaloid](https://signaloid.com). I am hugely interested in
all sorts of software projects, particularly tools which provide principled
and intuitive solutions to hard problems. In other words, tools that remove
the fear from programming.
