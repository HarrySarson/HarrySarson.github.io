University of Cambridge graduate in electrical and information engineering
working at [Garrison Technology](https://garrison.com). I am hugely interested in
all sorts of software projects, particularly tools which provide principled
and intuitive solutions to hard problems. In other words, tools that remove
the fear from programming.

I currently maintain the npm
[elm-test](https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-test-runner) package. The test
runner, widely used by the elm community, has recently received some much
needed contributions its code base. It has been a huge privilege to steer the
project back into active development.

Find me on the [elm slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/) or the [elm-in-elm
discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/d6kkjg7).
