A thesis summing up my masters (part IIB) project.
Writen in the early summer of 2019.
During the year long project I studied uncertainty propagation &mdash; methods that encode information about potential errors in data originating from the real world and produce estimates of how wrong the output of calculations using that data might be. 

The thesis describes a framework for uncertainty propagation and sketches an extension to the RISC-V instruction set architecture.
I think it is the best thing I have ever written, although the bar is admittedly quite low.
At least two other people must have liked it too as I received a distinction for the project.

Unfortunately, I have lost the final version.
I found the pdf attached here in an email sent to my Mum for final proof reading.
It will certainly be almost identical to the final version.
